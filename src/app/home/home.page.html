					<h3>About</h3>
					<h2>Who we are.</h2>
					<p>Last Call was founded in 2017 by two college students with a mission to change the world.<br /><br />Erin attended George Washington University on a full-ride scholarship, and struggled to afford food on campus when GW took away its dining hall. Chloe worked with the World Wildlife Fund’s Food Waste team for two years, learning more each day about how wasting 1/3 of all the food we produce affects our environment and society.<br /><br />With restaurants responsible for 40% of this food waste while 1 in 7 local residents are food insecure, Erin and Chloe realized they needed a better solution. Thus, Last Call was born with the mission to reduce restaurant food waste and provide more affordable food to our community.</p>
